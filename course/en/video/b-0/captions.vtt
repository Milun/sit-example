00:00:00.416 --> 00:00:03.533
There are regulatory requirements for nearly everything

00:00:03.533 --> 00:00:07.950
you do in the tourism, travel, hospitality and event industries:

00:00:08.183 --> 00:00:10.850
processing payments, protecting customers,

00:00:11.066 --> 00:00:12.233
preparing meals,

00:00:12.233 --> 00:00:15.650
employing staff, advertising products and services,

00:00:15.866 --> 00:00:18.216
paying super, wages and taxes.

00:00:18.233 --> 00:00:21.383
The list goes on and on and on.

00:00:22.133 --> 00:00:23.900
How do you comply with the laws?

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.300
Do you have to be a lawyer? No.

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:29.633
But you do need to have a detailed understanding of laws

00:00:29.633 --> 00:00:31.616
that all businesses must follow,

00:00:31.616 --> 00:00:34.800
as well as licensing which is specific to your establishment.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.316
This means doing some research!

00:00:37.816 --> 00:00:39.833
Ignorance is no excuse.

00:00:40.016 --> 00:00:41.633
You must be responsible

00:00:41.633 --> 00:00:44.666
and keep up to date with your business's legal requirements.
